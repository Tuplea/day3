        <i><h3>Man is not Made for Defeat</h3></i>
        <p>
            Man is never made for defeat. A man may be destroyed but he can NEVER be defeated.

When a man is killed, he is destroyed. For there is no hope for a dead man.

'
But while a man has his breathe, he keeps fighting till his dying days.

'

Even at the verge of death, as his strength deserts him, he still fight death.

'

What then makes a man is his ability to fight. The more he wins, the more he fight. The more he lose, the harder he should fight.

'
All men will have a fair share of life's successes and failures. How you handle each is what makes a difference.

You can choose to be strong and keep fighting. Or you can get weak and meet your destruction early.

When no one believes in you, you can choose to believe in yourself and keep chasing your dreams. Or you can choose to submit to fate.

                Winston Churchill said "....Never give in -- never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to
                 convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy."</p>
